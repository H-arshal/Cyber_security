- **Nmap Simulator**: A frontend-based simulation of how Nmap works, allowing users to test various commands interactively.

## How It Works
- Navigate through different sections to learn about Nmap commands.
- Use the **Simulator** to understand the expected results of different scans.
- Learn how to efficiently use Nmap for network reconnaissance and security testing.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend development
- **Node.js & npm**: Package management
- **(Optional Backend Integration)**: If a backend is implemented later
