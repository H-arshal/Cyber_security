          <h2>What is Nmap?</h2>
          <p>
            Nmap (short for Network Mapper) is an open-source command-line tool
            used for scanning IP addresses, ports, and detecting installed
            applications on a network. It allows security professionals and
            network administrators to discover devices, detect open ports, and
            identify vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally developed by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), Nmap has become widely
            popular in cybersecurity, even making appearances in movies like The
            Matrix and the series Mr. Robot.
