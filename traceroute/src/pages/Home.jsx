          <h2>What is Traceroute?</h2>
          <p>
            Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track the pathway
            that packets take from your computer to a destination server. It
            helps network administrators and cybersecurity professionals
            understand routing paths, diagnose slow connections, and detect
            network issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            By displaying each hop along the route, Traceroute reveals delays,
            dropped packets, and potential bottlenecks. It is available on
            Windows (`tracert` command) and Linux/macOS (`traceroute` command).
